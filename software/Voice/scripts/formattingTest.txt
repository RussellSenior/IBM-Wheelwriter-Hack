Here is some text that is **bold**.
Here is some text that is __underlined__.
This __underlined text spans
across two lines__, and this **bold text
spans across two lines**. This is regular text.
__**This text is both bold and underlined**__.
This is an example of an asterisk and underline on their own: * and _.
If we want two asterisks, we have to escape one of them: \**
We have to be careful to escape any two in a row: \**\**\**.
