Hello, Nick!

  Here is the Wheelwriter printer connector you requested. Enjoy!

  Obviously, feel free to email me for more instructions, but this should get
you up to speed:

1. If you have a Mac, everything should be ready to go. With a Windows PC, I 
think we may need to talk directly.

2. Go ahead and plug the device into your typewriter, in the proper orientation 
as shown on the connector. Plug the other end into your computer. You may need 
to set up a device driver, so if the following doesn't work automatically, email
me and we'll figure it out.

2. Assuming you are on a Mac, open up a terminal, and type the following (feel 
free to change to whatever directory you want, but this will put the software 
into your home folder):

**git clone https://github.com/tofergregg/IBM-Wheelwriter-Hack.git
cd IBM-Wheelwriter-Hack/software/Voice/scripts/
./server.py**

You should see a message that says, "Setting up..." and it may choose the device
for you (or you may have to choose -- the one you want should be labeled 
something like "/dev/tty.usbserial-14330".

If it works, you should see a message that says, "Waiting for a connection"

3. Open a **new** terminal using Shell--New Window
4. Type:
**cd IBM-Wheelwriter-Hack/software/Voice/scripts/
./simpleTest.sh**

Hopefully, you will see "Hello, World!" printed on the typewriter. If you don't,
we can troubleshoot.

5. For more advanced tests, you can type:
**./testDocSend.sh
./testAll.sh
./sendDoc.sh text/formattingTest.txt**

6. In general, if you just want to send text, type the following:
**./send_command.py characters "This is some text"**

7. If you want to add some formatting, like bold (\**) and underline (\__), you
can use the "-m" flag:
**./send_command.py characters -m "This is \**some bold\** text"**

8. If you want to send a file, you can type:
**./sendDoc.sh filename.txt**

Just remember that there is no auto-returning, so each line should be less 
than about 80 characters, and plain (or formatted, as described above) text.

Again, let me know if you have any troubles. I will work on some voice-activated 
typing in the near future. Cheers!

Chris
