Hello, Nick!

  Here is the Wheelwriter printer connector you requested. Enjoy!

  Obviously, feel free to email me for more instructions, but this should get you up to speed:

1. If you have a Mac, everything should be ready to go. With a Windows PC, I think we may need to talk directly.

2. Assuming you are on a Mac, open up a terminal, and type the following (feel free to change to whatever directory you want, but this will put the software into your home folder):

**git clone https://github.com/tofergregg/IBM-Wheelwriter-Hack.git**
cd
